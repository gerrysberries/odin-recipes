    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tired of spending $$$ on Korean Fried Chicken? So was I until I found Maangchi's recipe. Now I can make some from the comfort of my own home and it tastes just as yummy! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup potato starch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><em>For the sauce:</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/3 cup rice syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup gochujang</li>
        <li>2 tsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>corn (or vegetable oil) for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Fry chicken:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large heavy frying pan or pot over medium hight heat for about 10 to 12 minutes until it reaches 330-350ºF. I used my 12 inch pan but if your pan is smaller, work by batches. If you don’t have a thermometer, test it by dipping one piece of chicken in the oil. If it bubbles, it is ready.</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, combine chicken, salt, ground black pepper, starch, flour, baking soda, and eggs in a bowl. Mix altogether well by hand.</li>
        <li>Add the coated chicken to hot oil one by one. Fry them for 12 minutes until the all sides of the chicken are crunchy, turning over with tongs.</li>
        <li>Take out the chicken with tongs or a large slotted spoon to wire strainer over a bowl to remove the excess oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Make sauce and start the second fry:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the oil heat up for 2 minutes over medium high heat until it reaches 330-350ºF.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken one more time, turning over with tongs for about another 12 minutes until very crunchy.</li>
        <li>Reheat the sauce over medium high heat until it’s bubbling again. Add all the hot crunchy chicken and mix well with a wooden spoon and tongs.sweet spicy crunchy Korean fried chicken</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Finish and serve!</h4>
    <ol><li>Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and transfer to a serving plate. Serve with chicken-mu (pickled radish) if oyu have it.</li></ol>
